The setting is a quiet, natural forest in a low-fantasy world. The world contains no modern technology and is filled with subtle, grounded mystery rather than overt magic.

The player begins in a small forest clearing surrounded by tall trees and soft grass. The air is fresh and cool. Birds can be heard in the distance, and a narrow footpath leads out of the clearing.

Maintain a grounded, immersive tone. Avoid exposition or worldbuilding dumps — everything should feel like it’s being discovered, not explained.
