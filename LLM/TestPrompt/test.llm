Generate the first scene of a dark fantasy text adventure. Follow these rules:

- Always respond with **only valid JSON**
- Include a `"description"` field with a short narrative (1-2 sentences)
- Include an `"options"` array with 2-5 possible player actions
- Do not add commentary, markdown, or anything outside the JSON

Example format:
{
  "description": "You are standing in a moonlit clearing surrounded by ancient trees.",
  "options": ["Look around", "Walk north", "Sit and wait"]
}
